Step by step approach for using the docker deployment:

-- Make sure model_app, requirements.txt, Dockerfile, model .pkl file into the same folder
-- Browser to the folder path on command prompt.

Steps involved: Create a local  docker image, login to docker hub repository from command prompt, push the files to the docker hub central repository

Step 1: create an image in the local docker

# use this command to run and create a docker build. last .(dot) is important to pick all the files within this folder
command: docker build -t janatahack-cross-sell-api-test:1.0 .

step 2: In the command prompt, run the below command to authenticate with docker hub credentials
command: docker login -u santoshravikanti
Password:

--> we will receive login succeeded after logging in

step 3: create a new tag name for pushing into docker hub
command: docker tag janatahack-cross-sell-api-test:1.0 santoshravikanti/janatahack-cross-sell-api-test:1.0

step 4: push the docker image into the docker hub using the tag created just now
command: docker push santoshravikanti/janatahack-cross-sell-api-test:1.0

step 5: to check the docker run locally, run this command to run the local image (Not the docker hub one on the cloud)
command: docker run -p 80:80 janatahack-cross-sell-api-test:1.0

step 6: to check the docker run on cloud, run this command to run the docker hub image (docker hub one on the cloud)
command: docker run -p 80:80 santoshravikanti/janatahack-cross-sell-api-test:1.0
